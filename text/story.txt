My first experience with code was at 8 years old with a once-a-week HTML class.I really started coding when I was 15 on the TI-83+ calculator in my free time. At 16 I started taking formal programming classes, learning HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP during my junior year at Brooklyn Technical High School. Towards the end of the year, I learned the basics of Java to enter in a team programming competition, where I led my team to 8th place out of over 50 teams. Over the summer, I interned at Rodale inc. as a Front End Developer,  where i picked up some CSS tricks. During my senior year in high school, I formally learned Java, and took half of an online course on Android, after which i was confident enough to write my own apps. I aced the AP Computer Science A exam with a 5/5 and placed 8th at St. Joseph's College High School Programming Competition for a second time. Now I'm studying at City College
